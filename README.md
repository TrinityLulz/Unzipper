# Unzipper
Unzipper for web created by TrinityLulz.

The Unzipper extracts .zip and .rar archives or .gz/tar.gz files on webservers. It detects .zip/.rar/.tar.gz/.gz archives and let you choose which one to extract (if there are multiple archives available). As of version 0.1.0 it also supports creating archives.

It's easy, you do not need shell access. E.g. if you want to upload a lot of files (php framework or image collection) as archive - because it is much faster than uploading each file by itself.
